# Mocha, Chai, and Sinon for Testing
This repository is configured to use **Mocha**, **Chai**, and **Sinon** for unit and integration testing. These tools allow for writing effective and maintainable tests that ensure the quality and reliability of your code.

## Why Use Mocha, Chai, and Sinon?

### Mocha
Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser. It makes testing easy, with built-in support for asynchronous tests, a flexible reporting system, and an easy-to-understand API.

- **Why Mocha?**: It offers a simple structure for writing tests and is highly customizable, allowing you to tailor your testing environment.
- **What does Mocha do?**: It runs tests, provides a testing framework, and reports test results.

### Chai
Chai is an assertion library that can be paired with Mocha for writing assertions in your tests. It supports different styles of assertions, such as `expect`, `should`, and `assert`.

- **Why Chai?**: It allows you to write expressive and readable assertions for your tests, improving code clarity.
- **What does Chai do?**: It provides a variety of ways to test values or conditions in your application and helps make your tests easier to understand.

### Sinon
Sinon is a library for creating spies, mocks, and stubs. Itâ€™s useful for testing functions that rely on external dependencies or side effects. You can use Sinon to isolate parts of your code for more focused testing.

- **Why Sinon?**: It allows you to replace dependencies, control external functions, and track function calls to ensure your code behaves as expected.
- **What does Sinon do?**: It provides tools to spy on functions, mock behaviors, or stub out parts of your application that you don't want to execute in a test environment.

## What Does This Repository Provide?

- **Mocha** is set up to run your tests.
- **Chai** provides the assertion library to validate your expectations in tests.
- **Sinon** allows you to create spies, mocks, and stubs to control or monitor code execution.
- The testing environment is configured to run tests with the command `npm test`.
